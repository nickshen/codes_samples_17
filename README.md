# Code samples (2015-2017)

Some raw code samples pulled rather hurriedly from previous projects. These include Unity3D game logic written in C#, Python for CS 61A assignments, and a Java Deque for CS 61B.

Other projects (web, design, etc) can be found at my website. http://nickshen.me/

Much of my work unfortunately resides in private repos.
